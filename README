This is my modification of ascope.el by Staton Sun on the
EmacsWiki. This adds the ability to trace all callers of a function
all the way up to the top level of your C program. Mainly so if you
change that function, you can see what you need to recompile.

To use:

1) Build your cscope indices (Go to source directory and type cscope -qbR)

2) M-X ascope-init and give it your source directory where your cscope
indices are.

3) M-X ascope-trace-back and give it a function name.

Or

(ascope-trace-back "function-name")

It will create new buffer and print the call tree in it.
